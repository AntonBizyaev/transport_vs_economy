# How Transport Tnfrastructure Deficit Can Affect Economic Development

Theoretical research suggests that transport infrastructure is a necessary condition for economic development, i.e. transport infrastructure deficit might hinder economic growth by creating a bottleneck effect. 

However, there is a gap in empirical understanding of this phenomenon, especially under international comparison.

## Problem

We need to investigate relationship between transport infrastructure and economic development using data analysis tools.

## Data

The data is present for 27 countries, has 17 variables and covers three time periods: 1995, 2005 and 2015.

The dataset has already been preprocessed for the purposes of research: every variable (whenever applicable) has been converted either into per capita terms or into percentages to allow for international comparison.
